            My tasks were to develop CRUD operations and
            more additional features such as generation of
            reports and filter/sort operations.
            The technology used was Django as Web Framework,
            JQuery to manage asynchronous request to the server.
            The deployment system used is Fabric in order
            to manage complex actions and ensure that the code
            has correctly deployed into the server.
            For testing the code it was
            used Selenium IDE and Selenium WebDriver
            test automation tool.
